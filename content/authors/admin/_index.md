Andreu Tortajada Navarro finished his graduate studies in 2020 under the supervision of Prof. Ruben Martin at ICIQ. He has focused his doctoral work on the study of new site-selective catalytic CO<sub>2</sub> utilization in organic synthesis and the use of  CO<sub>2</sub> with isotope labeling purposes. 

Nowadays, he is looking for a postodoctoral researcher position in organometallic chemstry and he is enrolled in a HighSchool teaching master program.
